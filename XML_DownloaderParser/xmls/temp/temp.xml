<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to a method for inspecting insertion states of a plurality of connectors inserted into a substrate, and a substrate inspection apparatus. More specifically, the present disclosure relates to a method for inspecting insertion states of a plurality of pins included in each of a plurality of connectors in order to inspect an insertion state of the plurality of connectors, and a substrate inspection apparatus.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Generally, a pin or connector insertion apparatus inserts a plurality of pins or a plurality of connectors including a plurality of pins into a plurality of holes formed on a substrate, for example, a printed circuit board (PCB). The substrate into which the plurality of pins or the plurality of connectors is inserted may be electrically connected to another component or substrate by using at least one of the inserted pins or at least one of the inserted connectors. Specifically, the pin or connector insertion apparatus moves an insertion head loaded with at least one pin or connector to a preset pin or connector insertion position, and then applies an insertion force to an insertion finger, whereby the insertion finger presses and inserts the pin or connector loaded on the insertion head into a hole formed in the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, due to the characteristics of the pins or connectors to be inserted, the setting error of the pin or connector insertion apparatus, the mechanical separation and defect of the pin or connector insertion apparatus, the non-planarity of the substrate, and the like, an error may occur in the pin or connector insertion process performed by the pin or connector insertion apparatus. Due to this, an insertion defect may occur in the pin or connector inserted into the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is time-consuming and costly for a user to inspect directly the insertion state of the pin or connector in order to detect such an insertion defect of the pin or connector. Moreover, the inspection may not be accurately performed. In addition, it is also time-consuming and costly for a user to directly take measures with respect to the pin or connector insertion apparatus in order to reduce the insertion defect of the pin or connector, which may lead to the problem that the productivity is deteriorated.</p>

<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a view for explaining a method of controlling a connector insertion apparatus by a substrate inspection apparatus according to various embodiments of the present disclosure. According to various embodiments of the present disclosure, the substrate inspection apparatus <b>100</b> may perform inspection of a substrate into which a plurality of connectors is inserted by a connector insertion apparatus <b>110</b>. For example, the connector may include a housing with one open surface and a plurality of pins disposed in the housing. The plurality of pins may be disposed within the housing such that a pin tail of each of the pins faces the open surface of the housing. The connector insertion apparatus <b>110</b> may perform a connector insertion process of inserting a connector including a plurality of pins into a substrate, and may transfer the substrate into which the plurality of connectors is inserted, to the substrate inspection apparatus <b>100</b>. Hereinafter, description will be made mainly on a case where the connector insertion apparatus <b>110</b> inserts a connector including a plurality of pins into a substrate. However, the present disclosure is not limited thereto. The connector insertion apparatus <b>110</b> may insert individual pins into the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In one embodiment, the substrate inspection apparatus <b>100</b> may inspect the insertion state of the plurality of pins included in each of the plurality of connectors inserted into the substrate transferred from the connector insertion apparatus <b>110</b>. The substrate inspection apparatus <b>100</b> may emit pattern light on one surface of the substrate. One surface of the substrate on which the pattern light is emitted and the other surface of the substrate into which the plurality of connectors is inserted may be opposite surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In one embodiment, by the connector insertion force applied to the connector including a plurality of pins toward the other surface of the substrate by the connector insertion apparatus <b>110</b>, the plurality of pins included in the connector may be inserted into the substrate through a plurality of holes formed in the substrate. In addition, the length of the pin tail of each of the plurality of pins included in the connector is set to be longer than the thickness of the substrate in order to ensure that the inserted connector is fixed to the substrate. Therefore, after the insertion of the connector is completed, a portion of the pin tail may protrude from one surface of the substrate. Since the pin tail is a portion of the pin as described above, the insertion state of the pin may be determined by inspecting the protruding state of the pin tail. In the case where the insertion state of the plurality of pins included in the connector cannot be directly inspected by using pattern light, first-wavelength light, second-wavelength light and third-wavelength light due to the arrangement of the plurality of pins in the housing as in the connector, the insertion state of each of the plurality of pins may be determined by inspecting the protruding state of the pin tail of each of the plurality of pins. In addition, since the plurality of pins is included in the connector, the insertion state of the connector including the plurality of pins may also be determined by determining the insertion state of each of the plurality of pins.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The substrate inspection apparatus <b>100</b> may receive the pattern light reflected from the pin tail of each of the plurality of pins included in the plurality of connectors. The substrate inspection apparatus <b>100</b> may measure a pin tail height, a pin tail position and the like of each of the plurality of pins by using the received pattern light, and may inspect the insertion state of the plurality of pins included in each of the plurality of connectors by using the measurement information about the pin tail of each of the plurality of pins. A specific method for inspecting the insertion state of the plurality of pins included in each of the plurality of connectors by the substrate inspection apparatus <b>100</b> will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">According to various embodiments of the present disclosure, the substrate inspection apparatus <b>100</b> may control the connector insertion apparatus <b>110</b> by using the inspection result of the insertion state of the plurality of pins included in each of the plurality of connectors inserted into the substrate. For example, the substrate inspection apparatus <b>100</b> may generate a control signal for adjusting at least one process parameter among a plurality of process parameters related to the connector insertion process of the connector insertion apparatus <b>110</b> by using the inspection result. The substrate inspection apparatus <b>100</b> may control the connector insertion apparatus <b>110</b> by transmitting the generated control signal to the connector insertion apparatus <b>110</b> so that the connector insertion apparatus <b>110</b> can adjust at least one process parameter according to the received control signal. A specific method for generating the control signal for adjusting at least one process parameter by the substrate inspection apparatus <b>100</b> will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As described above, the substrate inspection apparatus <b>100</b> may quickly and accurately inspect an insertion state of the plurality of connectors inserted into the substrate by using the measurement information of the pin tail measured using the pattern light. In addition, the substrate inspection apparatus <b>100</b> may use the inspection result to efficiently control the connector insertion apparatus <b>110</b> to reduce the insertion defect caused by an error of the connector insertion apparatus <b>110</b>.</p>

Hereinafter, for the sake of convenience of description, each of the components included in the substrate inspection apparatus <b>100</b> is expressed in a singular form. However, the present disclosure is not limited thereto. Each of the components may be plural.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In one embodiment, the communication circuit <b>210</b> may communicate with an external electronic device or an external server. For example, the communication circuit <b>210</b> may establish communication between the substrate inspection apparatus <b>100</b> and the connector insertion apparatus <b>110</b> for inserting a connector into a substrate. The communication circuit <b>210</b> may be connected to a network through wireless communication or wired communication to communicate with an external electronic device or an external server. As another example, the communication circuit <b>210</b> may be connected to an external electronic device in a wired manner to perform communication.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The wireless communication may include, for example, cellular communication (e.g., LTE, LTE Advance (LTE-A), Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Wideband CDMA (WCDMA), Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), Wireless Broadband (WiBro), and the like). Furthermore, the wireless communication may include short-range wireless communication (e.g., Wireless Fidelity (WiFi), Light Fidelity (LiFi), Bluetooth, Bluetooth Low Power (BLE), Zigbee, Near Field Communication (NFC), the like).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In one embodiment, the light source <b>220</b> may emit pattern light on an inspection target (e.g., a substrate). The light source <b>220</b> may emit the pattern light on the entire inspection target, or may emit the pattern light on at least one object (e.g., a pin inserted into the substrate) included in the inspection target. For example, the light source <b>220</b> may include a grating (not shown), a grating transfer device (not shown), and a projection lens part (not shown). The grating may convert the light emitted from the light source <b>220</b> into pattern light. The grating may be transferred by a grating transfer mechanism, for example a piezo actuator (PZT), to generate phase-shifted pattern light. The projection lens part may allow the pattern light generated by the grating to be emitted on the inspection target.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As another example, the light source <b>220</b> may include Digital Light Processing (DLP) or Liquid Crystal on Silicon (LCoS). The DLP or LCoS may convert light emitted from the light source <b>220</b> into pattern light so that the pattern light can be emitted on the inspection target.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">For example, the light source <b>220</b> may emit pattern light on one surface of a first substrate. One surface of the first substrate and the other surface of the first substrate into which the plurality of connectors is inserted may be opposite surfaces. The pattern light may be light having a pattern of a constant or specific period, which is emitted to measure a three-dimensional shape of the inspection target. The light source <b>220</b> may emit pattern light in which the brightness of stripes has a sine wave shape, on-off type pattern light in which bright and dark portions are repeatedly displayed, triangular-wave pattern light in which the change in brightness is a triangular waveform, or the like. However, this is merely for description purposes, and the present disclosure is not limited thereto. The light source <b>220</b> may emit various types of pattern light in which the change in brightness is repeated at a constant or specific period.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Furthermore, the light source <b>220</b> may emit first-wavelength light, second-wavelength light, and third-wavelength light on the inspection target. The light source <b>220</b> may emit first-wavelength light, second-wavelength light and third-wavelength light on the entire inspection target or at least one object included in the inspection target. For example, the light source <b>220</b> may emit first-wavelength light, second-wavelength light and third-wavelength light on one surface of the first substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In one embodiment, the light source <b>220</b> may sequentially emit first-wavelength light, second-wavelength light, and third-wavelength light, or may simultaneously emit at least two kinds of light. For example, the first-wavelength light may be red light, the second-wavelength light may be green light, and the third-wavelength light may be blue light. However, this is merely for description purposes, and the present disclosure is not limited thereto. The first-wavelength light, the second-wavelength light and the third-wavelength light may be light having different wavelengths.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Hereinafter, for the sake of convenience of description, there will be mainly described a case where the light source <b>220</b> emits pattern light. However, the present disclosure is not limited thereto.

<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In one embodiment, the image sensor <b>230</b> may receive the pattern light reflected from the pin tail of each of a plurality of pins included in the plurality of connectors. For example, the image sensor <b>230</b> may receive the pattern light reflected from the pin tail of each of the plurality of pins protruding from one surface of the first surface, and may use the received pattern light to generate an image (e.g., a three-dimensional image) for the pin tail of each of the plurality of pins.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Furthermore, the image sensor <b>230</b> may receive first-wavelength light, second-wavelength light and third-wavelength light, which are reflected from the pin tail of each of the plurality of pins. For example, when first-wavelength light, second-wavelength light and third-wavelength light are emitted from the light source <b>220</b> on one surface of the first substrate, the image sensor <b>230</b> may receive the first-wavelength light, the second-wavelength light and the third-wavelength light reflected from the pin tail of each of the plurality of pins, and may use the received first-wavelength light, the received second-wavelength light and the received third-wavelength light to generate an image (e.g., a two-dimensional image) for the pin tail of each of the plurality of pins. The image sensor <b>230</b> may transmit the generated image for the pin tail of each of the plurality of pins to the processor <b>250</b>. In addition, the image sensor <b>230</b> may include a plurality of image sensors that can receive light in the same direction or different directions.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">For example, the image sensor <b>230</b> may include a Charge Coupled Device (CCD) camera, a Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) camera, or the like. However, this is merely for description purposes, and the present disclosure is not limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In one embodiment, the memory <b>240</b> may store instructions or data related to at least one other component of the substrate inspection apparatus <b>100</b>. Furthermore, the memory <b>240</b> may store software and/or programs. For example, the memory <b>240</b> may include an internal memory or an external memory. The internal memory may include at least one of a volatile memory (e.g., a DRAM, an SRAM or an SDRAM), and a non-volatile memory (e.g., a flash memory, a hard drive or a solid state drive (SSD)). The external memory may be functionally or physically connected to the substrate inspection apparatus <b>100</b> through various interfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In one embodiment, the memory <b>240</b> may store instructions for causing the processor <b>250</b> to operate. For example, the memory <b>240</b> may store instructions that cause the processor <b>250</b> to control other components of the substrate inspection apparatus <b>100</b> and to interwork with an external electronic device or server. The processor <b>250</b> may control other components of the substrate inspection apparatus <b>100</b> based on the instructions stored in the memory <b>240</b>, and may interwork with an external electronic device or server. Hereinafter, the operation of the substrate inspection apparatus <b>100</b> will be described by focusing on the respective components of the substrate inspection apparatus <b>100</b>. In addition, instructions for causing the respective components to perform operations may be stored in the memory <b>240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In one embodiment, the memory <b>240</b> may store insertion reference information indicating a pin tail reference height and a pin tail reference position set for the plurality of pins included in each of the first connectors inserted into the first substrate. As described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, each of the plurality of pins included in the connector is disposed in the housing and is difficult to be directly inspected by using pattern light or the like. Thus, the insertion state of the connector is determined based on the protruding state of the pin tail. Therefore, the insertion reference information may indicate a pin tail reference height and a pin tail reference position. Accordingly, the pin reference height and the pin reference position set for the plurality of pins included in each of the plurality of first connectors may be used to determine an insertion defect of the plurality of pins included in each of the plurality of first connectors. The insertion reference information may be set according to design information of the first substrate or a user input.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Furthermore, the memory <b>240</b> may further store information about a plurality of process parameters related to the connector insertion process of the connector insertion apparatus <b>110</b> and information about values of a plurality of process parameters used in the connector insertion process performed on the first substrate by the connector insertion apparatus <b>110</b>. The information about the plurality of process parameters and the information about the values of the plurality of process parameters may be received from the connector insertion apparatus <b>110</b> and stored in the memory <b>240</b>, or may be generated by a user input and stored in the memory <b>240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">For example, the information about the plurality of process parameters may include information indicating whether each of the plurality of process parameters can affect a connector insertion position, an inserted connector height, or the like. For example, it may be confirmed by using the information about the plurality of process parameters that a specific process parameter can affect a connector insertion position but cannot affect an inserted connector height. However, this is merely for description purposes, and the present disclosure is not limited thereto. One process parameter may affect both the connector insertion position and the connector height.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The information about the values of the plurality of process parameters may be used to determine how much to adjust at least one process parameter to be adjusted, when the adjustment of at least one process parameter among the plurality of process parameters is needed to reduce an insertion defect.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">For example, the plurality of process parameters related to the connector insertion process may include at least two of a process parameter for adjusting a connector insertion force, a process parameter for adjusting a connector insertion position, a process parameter for adjusting a connector insertion speed, a process parameter for adjusting a movement speed of a head used for connector insertion and a process parameter for adjusting a position of an anvil. However, this is merely for description purposes, and the present disclosure is not limited thereto. The plurality of process parameters may include various parameters related to the connector insertion process of the connector insertion apparatus <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In one embodiment, the processor <b>250</b> may drive an operating system or an application program to control at least one other component of the substrate inspection apparatus <b>100</b>, and may perform various data processing processes, calculation processes, and the like. For example, the processor <b>250</b> may include a central processing unit or the like, and may be implemented by a System on Chip (SoC).</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In one embodiment, the display <b>260</b> may include, for example, a liquid crystal display (LCD), a light emitting diode (LED) display, an organic light emitting diode (OLED) display, or the like. For example, the display <b>260</b> may display various contents (e.g., text, images, videos, icons, and/or symbols, etc.) to the user. The display <b>260</b> may include a touch screen, and may receive, for example, a touch, gesture, proximity, or hovering input performed by using an electronic pen or a user's body part.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In one embodiment, the processor <b>250</b> may generate insertion state information indicating an insertion state of each of the plurality of pins included in each of the plurality of first connectors by using the pattern light reflected from the pin tail of each of the plurality of pins included in each of the plurality of first connectors and received by the image sensor <b>230</b>. For example, the processor <b>250</b> may generate insertion state information for the plurality of pins included in each of the plurality of first connectors by using the image for the pin tail of each of the plurality of pins generated by the image sensor <b>230</b> by using the pattern light reflected from the pin tail of each of the plurality of pins. As another example, the image sensor <b>230</b> may transmit information about the received pattern light to the processor <b>250</b>. The processor <b>250</b> may generate an image for the pin tail of each of the plurality of pins, and may generate insertion state information for the plurality of pins included in each of the plurality of connectors by using the image for the pin tail of each of the plurality of pins. The processor <b>250</b> may display the generated insertion state information through the display <b>260</b>. This enables the user to identify the insertion state of the plurality of pins included in each of the plurality of first connectors inserted into the first substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In addition, the processor <b>250</b> may generate insertion state information for the plurality of pins included in each of the plurality of first connectors by using the image for the pin tail of each of the plurality of pins generated by the image sensor <b>230</b> by using the first-wavelength light, the second-wavelength light and the third-wavelength light reflected from the pin tail of each of the plurality of pins.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">For example, the insertion state information may include information indicating a pin tail height of each of the plurality of pins included in the connector, and information indicating a pin tail position. As described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the connector includes the housing in which the plurality of pins is disposed. Therefore, the insertion state of the plurality of pins included in the connector cannot be directly inspected by using pattern light, first-wavelength light, second-wavelength light and third-wavelength light. Thus, the processor <b>250</b> may determine the insertion state of the plurality of pins by inspecting the protruding state of the pin tail of each of the plurality of pins protruding from one surface of the substrate. In addition, the processor <b>250</b> may determine the insertion state of the connector including the plurality of pins according to the determination result. However, this is merely for description purposes, and the present disclosure is not limited thereto. The insertion state information may include various kinds of information available for determining the insertion state of the plurality of pins included in the connector.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In one embodiment, the processor <b>250</b> may detect at least one second connector having an insertion defect among the plurality of first connectors by using the insertion reference information and the insertion state information of the plurality of pins included in each of the plurality of first connectors. For example, the processor <b>250</b> may detect at least one second connector having an insertion defect by comparing the insertion reference information with the insertion state information of the plurality of pins included in the plurality of first connectors. Moreover, the processor <b>250</b> may display information about the detected at least one second connector on the display <b>260</b>. This enables the user to identify at least one second connector having an insertion defect. The insertion state information about the plurality of pins included in the detected at least one second connector may be used to control the connector insertion apparatus <b>110</b>. A specific method of detecting at least one second connector having an insertion defect will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In one embodiment, the processor <b>250</b> may generate a control signal for adjusting at least one first process parameter among the plurality of process parameters of the connector insertion apparatus <b>110</b>, based on the insertion state information of each of the plurality of pins included in at least one second connector having an insertion defect. The processor <b>250</b> may determine at least one first process parameter to be subjected to adjustment among the plurality of process parameters, based on the insertion state information for the plurality of pins included in the at least one second connector, and may generate a control signal for adjusting the determined at least one first process parameter.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The processor <b>250</b> may control the communication circuit <b>210</b> to transmit the generated control signal to the connector insertion apparatus <b>110</b>. A specific method for determining at least one first process parameter to be adjusted and generating a control signal for adjusting the at least one first process parameter will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In one embodiment, the connector insertion apparatus <b>110</b> may adjust at least one first process parameter according to the received control signal. After adjusting the at least one first process parameter, the connector insertion apparatus <b>110</b> may perform a process of inserting a plurality of first connectors into a substrate. The substrate inspection apparatus <b>100</b> may perform inspection on the substrate into which the plurality of first connectors is inserted, in the same manner as described above. When an insertion defect occurs in at least one of the plurality of first connectors inserted into the substrate, the substrate inspection apparatus <b>100</b> may generate a control signal for adjusting at least one of the plurality of process parameters of the connector insertion apparatus <b>110</b> in the same manner as described above, and may transmit the control signal to the connector insertion apparatus <b>110</b> once again. While repeating the above process, the substrate inspection apparatus <b>100</b> may control the connector insertion apparatus <b>110</b> so that the connector insertion apparatus <b>110</b> may operate at optimum process parameters.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref> are side views of the pin according to various embodiments of the present disclosure. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, the upper end portion of the pin <b>310</b> may be denoted by a pin tip <b>311</b>, the portion that makes contact with the substrate <b>320</b> upon insertion may be denoted by a pin shoulder <b>312</b>, and the lower end portion of the pin <b>310</b> may be denoted by a pin tail <b>313</b>. When the pin <b>310</b> is included in the housing of the connector (not shown), the portion extending from the pin tip <b>311</b> to the pin shoulder <b>312</b> may be located inside the housing of the connector, and only the pin tail <b>313</b> may be located outside the housing of the connector. Thus, when viewing the connector from the outside, only the pin tail <b>313</b> may be observed.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In addition, when the pin <b>310</b> is inserted into the substrate <b>320</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, at least a portion of the pin tail <b>313</b> may protrude from the substrate <b>320</b>. Since the pin tail <b>313</b> is a portion of the pin <b>310</b>, the protruding state of the pin tail <b>313</b> may be determined according to the insertion state of the pin <b>310</b>. Therefore, the processor <b>250</b> may determine the insertion state of the pin <b>310</b> by inspecting the protruding state of the pin tail <b>313</b>. In addition, since the pin <b>310</b> is included in the connector, the processor <b>250</b> may also determine the insertion state of the connector including the pin <b>310</b> by determining the insertion state of the pin <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref> illustrate a substrate into which a plurality of first connectors is inserted according to various embodiments of the present disclosure.

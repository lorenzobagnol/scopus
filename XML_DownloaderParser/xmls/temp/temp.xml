<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a board inspecting apparatus and a board inspecting method using the same. More particularly, the present invention relates to a board inspecting apparatus inspecting an area in which distortion is compensated and a board inspecting method using the same.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In general, at least one printed circuit board (PCB) is provided in an electronic device, and various circuit components such as a circuit pattern, a connection pad portion, and a driving chip electrically connected to the connection pad portion are mounted on the printed circuit board.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In general, a board inspecting apparatus is used to verify that the above various circuit components are properly formed or placed on the printed circuit board.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A conventional board inspecting apparatus sets a predetermined inspection area and inspects whether solder is properly formed or specific circuit components are properly installed in the inspection area. In a conventional method of setting the inspection area, an area in which a circuit component should theoretically exist is merely set as an inspection area.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The inspection area should be precisely set to a desired location so that measurement may be performed properly. However, since a measurement target such as a printed circuit board may have distortions such as bending and twisting of a board, a conventional inspection area cannot be accurately set at a desired position, and there is a problem that a certain difference occurs between an image acquired by a camera of an image-capturing part and a position where the circuit component theoretically exists. Therefore, it is necessary to set an inspection area in which distortion of the measurement target as the above is compensated appropriately.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Conventionally, in order to set an inspection area in which distortion of a measurement target is appropriately compensated, there has been made an attempt to acquire and compare reference data and measurement data for the measurement area set on the board and compensate the same to thereby set an accurate inspection area, for example, in Korean Patent No. 10-1132779 of the applicant. However, since there are various options for distortion compensation, it has been difficult for a user to properly use these options.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Thus, a way of supporting a user to easily select options for distortion compensation is required.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE</heading>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, the present invention provides a board inspecting apparatus capable of improving user's convenience, and easily setting options for distortion compensation.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In addition, the present invention also provides a board inspecting method using the above-mentioned board inspecting apparatus.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Solution</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a board inspecting apparatus include a measuring section obtaining measurement data for at least a portion of a board, a processing section comparing the measurement data of the board and previously obtained reference data of the board, based on a plurality of feature objects set on the board, to perform warpage compensation for the board, and inspecting the board in which warpage is compensated, a display section displaying ranges for adjusting a first level of an inspection speed according to the warpage compensation and a second level of a precision of the warpage compensation, and an input section receiving, from a user, an input for the first level of the inspection speed and the second level of the precision as a setting combination that is specified to have a trade-off relationship. The processing section, when the inspection speed and the precision are established, designates a specific option corresponding to the established inspection speed and the established precision among a plurality options for increasing the precision of the warpage compensation so that the specific option is applied.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one embodiment, the display section may display the first level and the second level, respectively, as a first step and a second step which are discrete, or as a first weight ratio and a second weight ratio which are continuous.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a board inspecting method uses a board inspecting apparatus performing warpage compensation of a board serving as a measurement target and inspecting the board with warpage compensated. The board inspecting method is performed by the board inspecting apparatus. The board inspecting method includes displaying ranges for adjusting a first level of an inspection speed according to the warpage compensation and a second level of a precision of the warpage compensation, receiving, from a user, an input for the first level of the inspection speed and the second level of the precision as a setting combination that is specified to have a trade-off relationship, compensating warpage of the board based on feature object on the board, according to the setting combination of the first level of the inspection speed and the second level of the precision, and inspecting an inspection area of the board in which the warpage is compensated. In compensating warpage of the board, when the inspection speed and the precision are established, a specific option corresponding to the established inspection speed and the established precision among a plurality options for increasing the precision of the warpage compensation is designated so that the specific option is applied.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one embodiment, when displaying the first level and the second level, the first level and the second level may be respectively displayed as a first step and a second step which are discrete, or a first weight ratio and a second weight ratio which are continuous.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a computer readable non-transitory recording medium recording a program implementing the board inspecting method may be provided.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Advantageous Effects</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to the present invention, an interface for selecting an inspection speed and a precision for distortion compensation of a board as a specific setting combination having a trade-off relationship with each other is provided, and a specific option corresponding to the inspection speed and the precision is applied by the selection of the setting combination, thereby improving user's convenience and allowing a user to easily set options for distortion compensation.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In addition, when the inspection speed and the precision are displayed, the level of the inspection speed and the level of the precision are displayed in discrete steps or continuous weight ratios, thereby further improving user's convenience.</p>

<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Hereinafter, exemplary embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a conceptual view of a board inspecting apparatus according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a board inspecting apparatus <b>100</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention includes a measuring section <b>110</b>, a processing section <b>120</b>, and a display section <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The measuring section <b>110</b> obtains measurement data for at least a portion of the board <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The board <b>10</b> may be placed on a stage <b>20</b> and the stage <b>20</b> may be transferred to a predetermined position by control of the processing section <b>120</b> described later or by control of an externally provided transfer apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The measurement data may include a real photographed image of the board <b>10</b> or related data.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In one embodiment, the measuring section <b>110</b> may include a first illumination part <b>112</b>, a second illumination part <b>114</b>, and an image-capturing part <b>116</b>, and the measurement data may include a captured image obtained at the image-capturing part <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The first illumination part <b>112</b> may provide non-patterned illumination. The non-patterned illumination may be, for example, an illumination to obtain a plane image of the two-dimensional shape of the measurement target formed on the board <b>10</b>. The plane image may include at least one information of color, brightness or brightness, and saturation of the measurement target.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In one embodiment, the first illumination part <b>112</b> may include a plurality of illumination units arranged in a circular shape on the basis of the measurement target, which is a measurement object, when viewed in a plane view, to irradiate light. For example, the first illumination part <b>112</b> may include a light source that emits white light or monochromatic light of a predetermined color, and may irradiate a plurality of different color lights such as red, green, and blue at different inclination angles. In the first illumination part <b>112</b>, a plurality of LEDs may be continuously arranged so as to respectively have a ring shape.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The second illumination part <b>114</b> may provide pattern illumination. The pattern illumination may be, for example, an illumination for acquiring a pattern image from which a three-dimensional shape of the measurement target may be extracted. In one embodiment, the second illumination part <b>114</b> may include a plurality of pattern illumination units arranged to obliquely irradiate grating pattern light in different directions toward the measurement target. For example, the second illumination part <b>114</b> may illuminate the grating pattern light forming a grating pattern for obtaining three-dimensional shape information of the measurement target, obliquely based on a normal line perpendicular to the plane of the measurement target. Also, the second illumination part <b>114</b> may be disposed apart from each other along the circumferential direction about the measurement target, or may be arranged at each vertex of a polygon in which the measurement target is centered. The second illumination part <b>114</b> may be alternately arranged at regular intervals in a position to divide a circumference. The pattern illumination units of the second illumination part <b>114</b> may be provided with M (M is a natural number greater than or equal to 2), and for example, may be provided with various numbers of 2, 4, or 8.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In one embodiment, each pattern illumination unit of the second illumination part <b>114</b> may illuminate the grating pattern light N times toward the measurement target (N is a natural number greater than or equal to 2). In order to illuminate phase-shifted grating pattern light, the pattern illumination unit may transfer grating pattern N times, by using a pattern image employing a digital light processing (DLP) method using a digital micro-mirror display (DMD), or a pattern image of a liquid crystal display device, and may transfer grating pattern by using a pattern image of various display method. Alternatively, the grating pattern may be physically transferred N times by using a grating transfer mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The image-capturing part <b>116</b> may obtain a two-dimensional plane image of the measurement target based on the non-patterned illumination of the first illumination part <b>112</b>, and may obtain a pattern image of the measurement target based on the patterned illumination of the second illumination part <b>114</b>. From the pattern image, a three-dimensional shape of the measurement target may be calculated, for example, by applying a method such as a bucket algorithm. On the other hand, the image-capturing part <b>116</b> may be provided with K (K is a natural number greater than or equal to 1), and may be arranged at various angles based on a normal line perpendicular to the plane of the measurement target. Also, the second illumination part <b>114</b> of the measuring section <b>110</b> may be provided with L (L is a natural number greater than or equal to 1), so that the measuring section <b>110</b> may include various types such as 1: K, L: 1, L: K, and the like between the second illumination part <b>114</b> and the image-capturing part <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The measurement data may include a captured image such as a two-dimensional plane image obtained from the image-capturing part <b>116</b>. In addition, the board <b>10</b> may be inspected using the two-dimensional plane image and/or the pattern image.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The processing section <b>120</b> performs distortion compensation of the board <b>10</b> by comparing the measurement data of the board <b>10</b> with previously obtained reference data of the board <b>10</b>, based on a plurality of feature objects set on the board <b>10</b>. In addition, the processing section <b>120</b> may perform various inspections for the board <b>10</b> with distortion compensation. For example, the processing section <b>120</b> may include a computer or a central processing part of a computer, and may include a control device performing a similar function.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Particularly, since there may be distortion in the inspection area set for the inspection of the board <b>10</b>, a predetermined feature object is established on the board in order to set the inspection area with distortion compensation, and the compensation may be performed by judging distortion of the inspection area based on the feature object. In this case, the feature object is a reference for comparing the measurement data of the board <b>10</b> and the previously obtained reference data of the board, and distortion compensation may be performed by comparing the feature object of the measurement data and the feature object of the reference data for associated feature objects.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In one embodiment, between known reference data or reference data taught according to a teaching mode and the measurement data such as a captured image, the distortion of the board is determined from the change of the feature object caused by the distortion of the board <b>10</b>, and then more accurate inspection may be performed by setting the inspection area with distortion compensation. For example, changes in the feature object may include changes in shape, changes in size, changes in a distance between the feature objects, changes in a geometry between the feature objects, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The establishment of the feature object may be done by user input via an input section described below or automatically by the processing section <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The distortion of the board <b>10</b> may occur in various forms due to various causes. For example, the board <b>10</b> may include distortion being such as bent, twisted, curved, rugged, etc., which are formed locally or globally due to the cause of manufacturing or handling. In one embodiment, the distortion compensation of the board <b>10</b> may include warpage compensation of the board.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The reference data may be a theoretical plane image for the board <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In one embodiment, the reference data may be obtained from CAD information or gerber information, which record the shape for the board <b>10</b>. The CAD information or gerber information includes design reference information of the board, and generally includes layout information about pads, circuit patterns, circular patterns, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In another embodiment, the reference data may be obtained from teaching information obtained by a teaching mode. In the teaching mode, for example, board information is searched in the database, and in case that board information is not available as a search result of the database, teaching of a bare board is performed. Then, the teaching of the bare board is completed and when board information such as pad and wiring information of the bare board is calculated, the board information is stored in the database. That is, the design reference information of a printed circuit board may be obtained by teaching the bare board of the printed circuit board in the teaching mode, and the reference data may be obtained by acquiring the teaching information through the teaching mode.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The reference data may be obtained in advance, and the measurement data may be distorted compared with the reference data due to bending, twisting, etc. of the board. Thus, by comparing the reference data with the measurement data, distortion compensation of the board <b>10</b> may be performed and the board <b>10</b> with distortion compensation may be inspected.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In this case, plurality of feature objects set on the board <b>10</b> may be used as a basis of the comparison. The feature objects may include a fiducial, a hole pattern, a corner portion of a curved circuit pattern and the like, which are formed on the board <b>10</b>. By comparing the reference data with the measurement data based on the coordinates of the center point of the hole pattern or the coordinates of the corner point of the curved circuit pattern, the distortion of the measurement data for the reference data, i.e., a conversion relationship between the reference data and the measurement data, which will be described later, may be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The display section <b>130</b> displays an image for inspection of the board <b>10</b>. For example, the display section <b>130</b> may include a display device such as a monitor connected to the processing section <b>120</b>. A user may perform an inspection of the board <b>10</b> using various videos and selection options displayed in the display section <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The display section <b>130</b> displays an inspection speed according to the distortion compensation and a precision of the distortion compensation, and the inspection speed and the precision are determined in a trade-off relationship.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a conceptual view for explaining an interface for setting an inspection speed and a precision in the board inspecting apparatus in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the display section <b>130</b> displays ranges for adjusting a first level of an inspection speed IS according to the distortion compensation and a second level of a precision PR of the distortion compensation. The inspection speed IS means a degree indicating how fast the inspection according to the distortion compensation is performed, and the precision PR means a degree indicating how precisely the distortion compensation is performed. For example, for the display, a &#x201c;Quick Setting&#x201d; window QS may be provided as a user interface (UI) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The inspection speed IS and the precision PR are determined in a trade-off relationship with each other. The precision PR may include various options to further refine the distortion compensation, and generally, additional time is required to process these options. Thus, when performing an option to increase the precision PR, the inspection speed IS may be slower, and in order to increase the inspection speed IS, options for increasing the precision PR are performed may not be performed. Therefore, the inspection speed IS and the precision PR are determined to have a trade-off relationship with each other, and an interface for adjusting levels of the inspection speed IS and the precision PR may be provided as a form of the quick setting window QS.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In one embodiment, the board inspecting apparatus <b>100</b> may further include an input section <b>140</b>. The input section <b>140</b> receives an input for a first level of the inspection speed IS and a second level of the precision PR from a user.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The input section <b>140</b> may receive the first level and the second level from the user so that the first level and the second level are simultaneously selected as the previously determined setting combination. That is, since the first level of the inspection speed IS and the second level of the precision PR are set in a trade-off relationship with each other, an interface may be provided so that the first level and the second level are selected as a setting combination that is specified to have a trade-off relationship by a user. Therefore, when any one of the first level of the inspection speed IS and the second level of the precision PR is selected, a remaining level corresponding to the selected level is automatically specified. For example, the first level and the second level may be discrete or continuous.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">For example, the input section <b>140</b> may include at least one of a computer keyboard, a mouse, a touch pad, and a touch panel. The input section <b>140</b> may include other input means as long as an input from a user is available.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The input section <b>140</b> may receive various commands necessary for the board inspection of the board inspecting apparatus <b>100</b> from a user in addition to inputting the inspection speed IS and the precision PR. For example, the input section <b>140</b> may receive a setting command of a feature object.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The display section <b>130</b> may display the inspection speed IS and the precision PR as a first step and a second steps, respectively, which are discrete. For example, the first step of the inspection speed IS may be represented by three discontinuous steps of &#x201c;high (Fast)&#x201d;, &#x201c;medium (Normal)&#x201d; and &#x201c;low (Slow)&#x201d; depending on the fast degree, and the second step of the precision PR may be represented by three discontinuous steps of &#x201c;high (Fine)&#x201d;, &#x201c;medium (Normal)&#x201d; and &#x201c;low (Coarse)&#x201d; depending on the precise degree.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Thus, the first step and the second step may be represented by three discontinuous setting combinations of a &#x201c;high-low&#x201d; combination, a &#x201c;medium-medium&#x201d; combination, and a &#x201c;low-high&#x201d; combination, and an interface may be provided so that a user select the inspection speed IS and the precision PR as a setting combination having a trade-off relationship.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a sliding bar SB may be provided in the quick setting window QS, and a user may select the above-mentioned discontinuous setting combination by adjusting the sliding bar SB.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Although the first level and the second level are respectively displayed by three discontinuous steps, and the setting combination is also illustrated as being displayed by three discontinuous setting combinations as described above, the first level and the second level may be displayed by two steps or four or more steps, and accordingly the setting combination may be displayed by two step combinations or four or more step combinations.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The board inspecting apparatus <b>100</b> may be provided with a plurality of options for increasing the precision of the distortion compensation, and the setting combinations may be selected in association with the plurality of options.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">For example, a plurality of options for increasing the precision of the distortion compensation may include an offset compensation option, an ROI compensation option, an enhancement model option, and the like. The options may have a range of data utilized for compensation. The offset compensation option is an option to compensate for distortion by correcting an offset after measuring solder. The ROI compensation option is an option to compensate for distortion by correcting an inspection area or a region of interest (ROI) before measuring solder. The enhancement model option is an option to compensate for distortion by increasing a pixel precision of a compensation model.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In one embodiment, when the inspection speed IS and the precision PR are established, a specific option corresponding to the established inspection speed IS and the established precision PR among a plurality options for increasing the precision of the warpage compensation may be automatically designated so that the specific option is applied.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">For example, when the first level and the second level are set to three discontinuous setting combinations of a &#x201c;high-low&#x201d; combination, a &#x201c;medium-medium&#x201d; combination, and a &#x201c;low-high&#x201d; combination, only the offset compensation among the three options may be applied in the &#x201c;high-low&#x201d; combination, the ROI compensation in addition to the offset compensation among the three options may be further applied in the &#x201c;medium-medium&#x201d; combination, and all the three options may be applied in the &#x201c;low-high&#x201d; combination.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In another embodiment, when the inspection speed IS and the precision PR are established, an application scope of a specific option corresponding to the established inspection speed and the established precision among a plurality options for increasing the precision of the distortion compensation may be automatically set.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">For example, when the first level and the second level are set to three discontinuous setting combinations of a &#x201c;high-low&#x201d; combination, a &#x201c;medium-medium&#x201d; combination, and a &#x201c;low-high&#x201d; combination, the application scope such as the number of the feature objects used in the ROI compensation, the pixel precision of the enhancement model and the like may be determined according to the setting combinations.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Meanwhile, the display section <b>130</b> may display the inspection speed IS and the precision PR as a first weight ratio and a second weight ratio, respectively, which are continuous. For example, the first weight ratio of the inspection speed IS may be displayed in the range of 0% to 100% depending on the fast degree, and the second weight ratio of the precision PR may be displayed as 0%/o to 100% depending on the precise degree.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Thus, the first weight ratio and the second weight ratio may be displayed by various combinations of continuous setting combinations such that the sum thereof is 100%. For example, the first weight ratio and the second weight ratio may be selected to be 64% and 36%, respectively, and when the first weight ratio is increased to 68%, the second weight ratio is forced to 32%. In this way, an interface may be provided for a user to select the inspection speed IS and the precision PR as a setting combination of a trade-off relationship.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">For example, a user may continuously move the slide bar SB to a specific point, and at any point including the specific point, the sum of the first weight ratio and the second weight ratio may be always 100%.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In this case, when the inspection speed IS and the precision PR are established, an application scope of a specific option corresponding to the established inspection speed and the established precision among a plurality options for increasing the precision of the distortion compensation may be automatically set.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">For example, when the first level and the second level are located at a specific point and the first weight ratio and the second weight ratio are set, the application scope such as the number of the feature objects used in the ROI compensation, the pixel precision of the enhancement model and the like may be determined according to a criterion predetermined corresponding to the first weight ratio and the second weight ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">As described above, the board inspecting apparatus <b>100</b> provides an interface for selecting a setting combination having a trade-off relationship between the inspection speed and the precision for compensating the distortion of the board <b>10</b>, to thereby improve user's convenience and allow a user to easily set options for distortion compensation.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flow chart showing a board inspecting method according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>, in order to inspect a board <b>10</b> according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, first, the inspection speed IS according to the distortion compensation and the precision PR of the distortion compensation are displayed in step of S<b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">For example, as described above, the display section <b>130</b> displays ranges for adjusting levels of the inspection speed IS required by the distortion compensation and the precision PR of the distortion compensation, and a quick setting window QS may be provided as a user interface.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Then, the inspection speed IS and the precision PR are inputted as a setting combination that is specified to have a trade-off relationship in step of S<b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">For example, as described above, the input section <b>140</b> may receive the inspection speed IS and the precision PR from a user in the quick setting window QS, and the processing section <b>120</b> may set the inspection speed IS and the precision PR based on the input information.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In addition, the inspection speed IS and the precision PR may be displayed as a first level and a second level, respectively, by the display section <b>130</b>. The first level and the second level may be simultaneously selected as a specific setting combination having a trade-off relationship by a user.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">For example, the first level of the inspection speed IS and the second level of the precision PR may be displayed, by the display section <b>130</b>, as discrete first and second steps, respectively, or as a continuous first and second weight ratios, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Thereafter, according to the inspection speed IS and the precision PR, the distortion of the board is compensated based on the feature object on the board in step of S<b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">For example, as described above, according to the inspection speed IS and the precision PR, the processing section <b>120</b> may automatically designate a specific option to be applied, or set an application scope of a specific option.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Accordingly, the processing section <b>120</b> compares measurement data of the board <b>10</b> and previously obtained reference data of the board on the basis of the feature object and performs distortion compensation of the board <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Then, an inspection area of the board in which the distortion is compensated is inspected in step of S<b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">For example, as described above, the processing section <b>120</b> may perform various types of inspections for defectiveness of the board <b>10</b> in which the distortion is compensated.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">According to the board inspecting apparatus and the board inspecting method using the same, an interface for selecting an inspection speed and a precision for distortion compensation of a board as a specific setting combination having a trade-off relationship with each other is provided, and a specific option corresponding to the inspection speed and the precision is applied by the selection of the setting combination, thereby improving user's convenience and allowing a user to easily set options for distortion compensation.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In addition, when the inspection speed and the precision are displayed, the level of the inspection speed and the level of the precision are displayed in discrete steps or continuous weight ratios, thereby further improving user's convenience.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations may be made in the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention.

<p id="p-0001" num="0000">In a rotary head type component mounter, before using two suction nozzles of rotary head to pick up the leading components in component supply tape set in two tape feeders, rotary head is moved in the XY directions by head moving mechanism and rotated by head rotating mechanism such that the pickup points of the two suction nozzles are positioned on two straight lines and extending in the tape feeding direction of each tape feeder passing through the ideal pickup points of the leading components of the two tape feeders, and the leading components are fed to component pickup positions and that are the pickup points of the suction nozzles on the two straight lines. Then, the two suction nozzles of rotary head are lowered simultaneously to pick up the two component simultaneously using the two suction nozzles.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application relates to a component pickup position correction system and component pickup position correction method for a rotary head type component mounter provided with a function that corrects the position at which to pick up a component that is supplied by a tape feeder.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">When a component mounter picks up a component supplied from a tape feeder with a suction nozzle, if the component pickup position is deviated, pickup errors and the like are more likely to occur, making it necessary to perform correction to align the position of the suction nozzle with the position of the next component to pick up. Thus, conventionally, correction is performed to align the position of the suction nozzle with the position of the next component to pick up (a target component pickup position) by moving the mounting head that holds the suction nozzles in the XY directions (left-right and front-rear directions).</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Further, with a rotary head type component mounter, as disclosed in patent literature 1 (JP-A-H9-270595), the position of the next component to pick up is recognized by imaging that component with a component recognition camera and performing image processing, and then, based on the recognized position, the position of the suction nozzle is corrected by slightly rotating the rotary head that holds the suction nozzle.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Also, as disclosed in patent literature 2 (JP-A-2012-164881), to improve productivity, a Z-axis drive mechanism that lowers multiple of the suction nozzles is provided on the rotary head, and pickup of multiple components is performed simultaneously by lowering multiple suction nozzles simultaneously.</p>

<p id="p-0007" num="0007">However, even when picking up multiple components simultaneously by lowering multiple suction nozzles simultaneously as in patent literature 2, to prevent pickup errors and the like, it is desirable to perform correction of the deviation of the component pickup position for each component. Here, one may consider applying the component pickup correction technology of patent literature 1 to the rotary head type component mounter of patent literature 2, that is, recognizing the positions of the next multiple components to pick up by imaging those components with a component recognition camera and performing image processing, then rotating the rotary head slightly based on the positions of the multiple components, thus correcting the positions of the multiple nozzles that pick up the multiple components.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0008">However, the deviation of the component pickup position is not uniform for multiple components, with the deviation direction and the deviation amount being unrelated; thus, with the component pickup correction method of patent literature 1, it is not possible to correct the deviation of multiple component pickup positions simultaneously. Therefore, if the deviation amount of the component pickup position of multiple components exceeds a tolerance amount beyond which stable pickup is not possible, it is difficult to perform simultaneous pickup of multiple components, meaning that components must be picked up one by one and the component pickup positions corrected one by one, meaning that productivity cannot be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0009">Thus, an object of the present disclosure is to simultaneously pick up two components fed to two component pickup positions.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0010">To solve the above problems, the present disclosure is a component pickup position correction method of a rotary head type component mounter, the method including: feeding a component stored in component supply tape to a component pickup position by performing feeding operation of the component supply tape using multiple tape feeders; holding multiple suction nozzles at a specified interval in a circumferential direction on a rotary head; revolving the multiple suction nozzles in the rotation direction of the rotary head by rotating the rotary head using a head rotating mechanism; using a Z-axis drive mechanism to pick up the component by lowering the suction nozzle that is positioned above the component pickup position of one of the multiple tape feeders; using a head moving mechanism to move the rotary head in the XY directions between a component pickup station at which component pickup operation is performed and a component mounting station at which component mounting operation is performed, using the Z-axis drive mechanism, which is provided in two locations, to cause simultaneous pickup of the leading components in two of the tape feeders by simultaneously lowering the two suction nozzles that are positioned above the component pickup positions of two of the multiple tape feeders, and, when correcting the component pickup positions of the leading components of the two tape feeders to be picked up, moving the rotary head in the XY directions using the head moving mechanism such that the pickup points of the two suction nozzles are positioned on two straight lines extending in the tape feeding direction of each tape feeder passing through an ideal pickup point of the leading components of the two tape feeders, rotating the rotary head using the head rotating mechanism, and feeding the leading components to the component pickup positions that are the pickup points of the suction nozzles on the two straight lines by performing tape feeding operation of the two tape feeders. Here, an ideal pickup point of a component is generally considered to be the center of the component or the center of gravity of the component, which is a pickup point at which the component can be picked up stably by a suction nozzle.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0011">Even in cases in which the positions of the leading components in component supply tape set in two tape feeders are deviated, or in which the positions of two suction nozzles used to pick up those components are deviated, with the present disclosure, because the rotary head is moved in the XY directions and rotated such that the pickup points of the two suction nozzles are positioned on two straight lines extending in the tape feeding direction of each tape feeder passing through an ideal pickup point of the leading components of the two tape feeders, and the leading components are fed to the component pickup positions that are the pickup points of the suction nozzles on the two straight lines by performing tape feeding operation of the two tape feeders, it is possible to pick up the components at two component pickup positions simultaneously by lowering the two suction nozzles simultaneously, thereby improving productivity.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0012">With the present disclosure, position data of multiple suction nozzles that is measured in advanced may be memorized on a memory device, and a calculating device may calculate an XY direction movement amount and rotation angle of the rotary head required to move to the component pickup positions of the two tape feeders and a tape feeding amount of the two tape feeders, based on the positions of the ideal pickup points of the leading components of the two tape feeders and the positions of the two suction nozzles obtained by searching for the position data of the two suction nozzles used to pick up the leading components from the two tape feeders from the position data memorized on the memory device. According to this, it is possible to simply and accurately calculate the positions (the two component pickup positions) of the pickup points of the two suction nozzles on the straight lines based on the geometrical positional relationship between the positions of the two pickup nozzles that are to pick up the two components, and the positions of the ideal pickup points of the two leading components, and it is possible to simply and accurately calculate the XY direction movement amount and rotation angle of the rotary head required to move to the two component pickup positions and the tape feeding amount of the two tape feeders.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0013">In this case, the two tape feeders may be feeders with the same tape feeding pitch (component size), feeders for which the tape feeding pitches are different, or feeders that feed components of different sizes to the component pickup positions. For components of different sizes, because the position of the ideal pickup points (center or center of gravity) are deviated from the tape feeding direction, conventionally, it was not possible to pick up two different-sized component simultaneously, but simultaneous pickup of two different-sized components is possible with the present disclosure.</p>

<heading id="h-0009" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0021">An embodiment of the disclosure is described below. First, the configuration of rotary head type component mounter <b>10</b> is described based on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0022">Conveyor <b>13</b> that conveys circuit board <b>12</b> is provided on base <b>11</b> of rotary head type component mounter <b>10</b> (below, the conveyance direction of circuit board <b>12</b> by conveyor <b>13</b> is referred to as the X direction). Of support members <b>15</b><i>a </i>and <b>15</b><i>b </i>that support the two conveyor rails <b>13</b><i>a </i>and <b>13</b><i>b </i>and conveyor belts <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b </i>that configure conveyor <b>13</b>, support member <b>15</b><i>a </i>is fixed at a specified position, with the support member <b>15</b><i>b </i>on the opposite side being adjusted in the Y direction (positioned perpendicular to the X direction) along guide rail <b>16</b> by a feed screw mechanism (not shown) or the like such that the width of conveyor <b>13</b> (the gap between conveyor rails <b>13</b><i>a </i>and <b>13</b><i>b</i>) is adjustable to the width of circuit board <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0023">Further, device pallet <b>22</b> (feeder setting table) is detachably attached on base <b>11</b> to the side of conveyor <b>13</b>, with multiple tape feeders <b>23</b> being detachably set on device pallet <b>22</b> in the Y direction. Reel <b>20</b> on which is wound component supply tape that stores many components in a row at a regular pitch is set on each tape feeder <b>23</b>, sprocket holes formed along the edges of the component supply tape pulled out from reel <b>20</b> in the Y direction engage with teeth of a sprocket (not shown), and by tape feeding operation in the Y direction caused by rotation of the sprocket, a component in the component supply tape is fed to a component pickup position (a position at which suction nozzle <b>26</b> picks up the component). With each tape feeder <b>23</b>, it is possible to finely adjust the feeding amount of the component supply tape (the rotation angle of the sprocket) by controlling the rotation angle of motor <b>27</b> that rotates the sprocket using control section <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0024">Head moving mechanism <b>25</b> that moves rotary head <b>24</b> in the XY directions between a component pickup station at which component pickup operation is performed and a component mounting station at which component mounting operation is performed is attached to component mounter <b>10</b>. Multiple suction nozzles <b>26</b> that pick up a component fed to the component pickup position by tape feeder <b>23</b> are held on rotary head <b>24</b> at a specified interval (regular pitch) in a circumferential direction. Rotary head <b>24</b> is provided with head rotating mechanism <b>31</b> that revolves the multiple suction nozzles <b>26</b> in a circumferential direction of rotary head <b>24</b> by rotating (on its own axis) rotary head <b>24</b> around its own central axis (R axis), Z-axis drive mechanism <b>32</b> that causes suction nozzle <b>26</b> to pick up a component by lowering the suction nozzle <b>26</b> at a specified stopping position (above the component pickup position) on the revolution path of the suction nozzles <b>26</b>, and nozzle rotating mechanism <b>33</b> that corrects the direction of a component picked up by suction nozzle <b>26</b> by rotating (on its own axis) suction nozzle <b>26</b> around its own center axis.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0025">In the present embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 to 5</figref>, two Z-axis drive mechanisms <b>32</b> are provided at two locations surrounding rotary head <b>24</b>, with the leading components of two tape feeders <b>23</b> being able to be simultaneously picked up by two suction nozzles <b>26</b> by the suction nozzles <b>26</b> being lowered simultaneously by the two Z-axis drive mechanisms <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0026">Each Z-axis drive mechanism <b>32</b> uses Z-axis motor <b>37</b> as an actuator, and by feed screw <b>38</b> being rotated by this Z-axis motor <b>37</b> such that Z-axis slide <b>39</b> is moved up and down, Z-axis slide <b>39</b> engages with engaging member <b>46</b> provided at the top end of nozzle holder <b>40</b> of rotary head <b>24</b>, which raises and lowers nozzle holder <b>40</b>, thus raising and lowering suction nozzle <b>26</b> held on the lower section of the nozzle holder <b>40</b>. Note that, Z-axis slide <b>39</b> may be moved up and down by a linear motor acting as Z-axis motor <b>37</b>. Alternatively, instead of a linear motor, a linear solenoid, an air cylinder, or the like may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0027">Also, component mounter <b>10</b> is provided with mark camera <b>35</b> (camera for imaging marks) that images reference position marks of circuit board <b>12</b> from above by being moved as one with rotary head <b>24</b>, and component camera <b>36</b> (camera for imaging components) that images a component picked up by suction nozzle <b>26</b> from below.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0028">Connected to control device <b>41</b> of component mounter <b>10</b> are, for example, input device <b>42</b> such as a keyboard, mouse, or touchscreen panel; memory device <b>43</b> (memory device) including a hard disk, RAM, ROM and so on for memorizing various types of programs, data, and the like; and display device <b>44</b> such as a liquid crystal display or CRT.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0029">During operation of component mounter <b>10</b>, operation is repeated such that, after component pickup operation has been performed by moving rotary head <b>24</b> to the component pickup station using head moving mechanism <b>25</b>, component mounting operation is performed by moving rotary head <b>24</b> to the component mounting station and mounting the component on circuit board <b>12</b>. At the component pickup station, components stored in component supply tape are fed to the component pickup positions by feeding operation of the component supply tape of two tape feeders <b>23</b>, the components are picked up simultaneously by the two suction nozzles <b>26</b> positioned above the component pickup positions being lowered simultaneously, and then the two suction nozzles <b>26</b> are raised to their original heights, these operations being repeated such that components are picked up in order by the multiple suction nozzles <b>26</b> held by nozzle holders <b>40</b> of rotary head <b>24</b>. Here, the two tape feeders <b>23</b> may be feeders with the same tape feeding pitch (component size), or, as in the present embodiment, two tape feeders <b>23</b> that perform simultaneous pickup with different tape feeding pitches, and that feed components of different sizes to the component pickup positions.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0030">If the component pickup positions are deviated during component pickup operation, a component pickup error is more likely to occur. In particular, in a case in which the tape feeding pitch of the two tape feeders <b>23</b> is different and components of different sizes are fed to the component pickup positions, the position of the ideal pickup point (stable pickup point) of the leading components of the two tape feeders <b>23</b> are deviated in the Y direction. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, even if the sizes of the components of component supply tape fed by the two tape feeders <b>23</b> is different, and the tape feeding pitch is different, because the peeling positions (Y coordinate) of the cover tape (top tape) that is on the component supply tape are the same, for two components of different sizes, the position of the ideal pickup points is deviated in the Y direction, that is, the tape feeding direction. It is necessary to correct the component pickup position of two components for which the position deviates as given above when performing simultaneous pickup.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0031">Thus, with the present embodiment, control device <b>41</b> of component mounter <b>10</b>, before performing component pickup operation, controls rotation operation and movement in the XY direction of rotary head <b>24</b>, and tape feeding operation of the two tape feeders <b>23</b>, to correct the two component pickup positions used for simultaneous pickup as described below. Here, the ideal pickup point (stable pickup point) of a component is generally considered to be the center of the component or the center of gravity of the component, which is the pickup point at which the component can be picked up stably by suction nozzle <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0032">As preparation, in advance, the positions of the multiple suction nozzles <b>26</b> held by rotary head <b>24</b> are measured by image recognition technology or the like, and the measurement data of the position of each suction nozzle <b>26</b> is memorized in memory device <b>43</b>. Then, first, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, rotary head <b>24</b> is moved in the XY directions by head moving mechanism <b>25</b> and rotated by head rotating mechanism <b>31</b> such that the pickup points of the two suction nozzles <b>26</b> are positioned on the two straight lines A<b>1</b> and A<b>2</b> extending in the tape feeding direction (Y direction) of each tape feeder <b>23</b> passing through the ideal pickup points (stable pickup points) of the leading components of the two tape feeders <b>23</b>, and the leading components are fed to component pickup positions C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b> that are the pickup points of the suction nozzles <b>26</b> on the two straight lines A<b>1</b> and A<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0033">The specific correction method for component pickup positions C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b> involves control device <b>41</b> (calculating device) searching for the measurement data of the position of the two suction nozzles <b>26</b> used to pick up the leading components of the two tape feeders <b>23</b> from the measurement data of the positions of the multiple suction nozzles <b>26</b> memorized in memory device <b>43</b>, and then calculating the rotation angle and movement amount in the XY directions of rotary head <b>24</b> required to move to the component pickup positions of the two tape feeders <b>23</b> and the feeding amount of the two tape feeders <b>23</b>, calculations being based on the positions of the two suction nozzles and the positions of the ideal pickup points of the leadings components of the two tape feeders <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0034">That is, if the position of each suction nozzle <b>26</b> is known in advance, the gap between the two suction nozzles <b>26</b> used for simultaneous pickup is known, therefore component pickup positions C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b> that are the pickup points of the two suction nozzles <b>26</b> on the two straight lines A<b>1</b> and A<b>2</b> are determined based on the geometrical positional relationship between the gap between the two straight lines A<b>1</b> and A<b>2</b> extending in the tape feeding direction (Y direction) passing through the ideal pickup points of the leading components of the two tape feeders <b>23</b>, and the gap between the pickup points of the two suction nozzles <b>26</b>. Further, if the component pickup positions C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b> are determined, because the position on the rotation path of suction nozzles <b>26</b> of rotary head <b>24</b> are thus determined unambiguously, the position of the rotation center of rotary head <b>24</b> is also determined unambiguously. From this, the movement amount in the XY directions of rotary head <b>24</b> required for simultaneous pickup of the components at component pickup positions C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b> can be calculated, and the rotation angle of rotary head <b>24</b> required for simultaneous pickup of the components at component pickup positions C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b> can be calculated from the position of the rotation center of rotary head <b>24</b>, the current position of the two suction nozzles <b>26</b>, and the component pickup positions C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b> on straight lines A<b>1</b> and A<b>2</b>. And, the tape feeding amount of the two tape feeders <b>23</b> required for simultaneous pickup of the components at component pickup positions C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b> can be calculated from the current positions of the leading components in the two tape feeders <b>23</b> and component pickup positions C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b> on straight lines A<b>1</b> and A<b>2</b>. Note that, the rotation center (turning circle of suction nozzles <b>26</b>) of rotary head <b>24</b> and the position information of the ideal pickup points of the components may be memorized in advance on memory device <b>43</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0035">In the example configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a total of sixteen suction nozzles <b>26</b> (N<b>1</b> to N<b>16</b>) are held on rotary head <b>24</b> arranged at a pitch of 22.5 degrees in a circumferential direction, the configuration being such that three suction nozzles <b>26</b> are positioned between component pickup positions C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b> of the two tape feeders <b>23</b>. That is, the gap between the two tape feeders <b>23</b> that pick up the components is set as the gap of the four angle pitch (22.5 degrees&#xd7;4=90 degrees) of rotary head <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0036">With regard to the order in which components are picked up by the sixteen suction nozzles <b>26</b> (N<b>1</b> to N<b>16</b>), first, rotary head <b>24</b> is moved in the XY directions by head moving mechanism <b>25</b> and rotated by head rotating mechanism <b>31</b> such that the pickup points of the two suction nozzles <b>26</b> are positioned on the two straight lines A<b>1</b> and A<b>2</b> extending in the tape feeding direction (Y direction) of each tape feeder <b>23</b> passing through the ideal pickup points of the leading components of the two tape feeders <b>23</b>, and the leading components of the component supply tape are fed to component pickup positions C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b> that are the pickup points of the suction nozzles <b>26</b> on the two straight lines A<b>1</b> and A<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0037">Following this position correcting operation, after the two suction nozzles <b>26</b> (N<b>1</b> and N<b>13</b>) positioned above component pickup positions C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b> of the two tape feeders <b>23</b> have been lowered simultaneously to pick up the two components simultaneously, rotary head <b>24</b> is rotated by one pitch (22.5 degrees), the next two suction nozzles <b>26</b> (N<b>2</b> and N<b>14</b>) are positioned above component pickup positions C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b>, and those two suction nozzles <b>26</b> (N<b>2</b> and N<b>14</b>) pick up the next two component simultaneously. Here, if it is necessary to perform correction again on the positions of the two suction nozzles <b>26</b> (N<b>2</b> and N<b>14</b>) and component pickup positions C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b>, the rotation angle and movement amount in the XY directions of rotary head <b>24</b> required for the correction, and the tape feeding amount of the two tape feeders <b>23</b> are calculated using the above method, and correction is performed again on component pickup positions C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b> by performing rotation operation and XY direction movement operation of rotary head <b>24</b> and tape feeding operation of tape feeders <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0038">Hereafter, in a similar manner, rotary head <b>24</b> is rotated by one pitch (22.5 degrees) (performing the above position correction operation as necessary), and the next two suction nozzles <b>26</b> (N<b>3</b> and N<b>15</b>) pick up the next two components simultaneously; then, rotary head <b>24</b> is rotated by one pitch (22.5 degrees) (performing the above position correction operation as necessary), and the next two suction nozzles <b>26</b> (N<b>4</b> and N<b>16</b>) pick up the next two components simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0039">After this, rotary head <b>24</b> is rotated by a five angle pitch (22.5 degrees&#xd7;5=112.5 degrees) (performing the above position correction operation as necessary), and the next two suction nozzles <b>26</b> (N<b>9</b> and N<b>5</b>) pick up the next two components simultaneously; then, rotary head <b>24</b> is rotated by one pitch (22.5 degrees) (performing the above position correction operation as necessary), the next two suction nozzles <b>26</b> (N<b>10</b> and N<b>6</b>) are positioned above the component pickup positions C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b>, and two components are picked up simultaneously by those two suction nozzles (N<b>10</b> and N<b>6</b>). Hereafter, in a similar manner, rotary head <b>24</b> is rotated by one pitch (22.5 degrees) (performing the above position correction operation as necessary), and the next two suction nozzles <b>26</b> (N<b>11</b> and N<b>7</b>) pick up the next two components simultaneously; then, rotary head <b>24</b> is rotated by one pitch (22.5 degrees) (performing the above position correction operation as necessary), and the next two suction nozzles <b>26</b> (N<b>12</b> and N<b>8</b>) pick up the next two components simultaneously. By this, component pickup operation is complete for the total of sixteen suction nozzles <b>26</b> (N<b>1</b> to N<b>16</b>) held on rotary head <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0040">According to the embodiment described above, because rotary head <b>24</b> is moved in the XY directions and rotated such that the pickup points of the two suction nozzles <b>26</b> are positioned on the two straight lines A<b>1</b> and A<b>2</b> extending in the tape feeding direction (Y direction) of each tape feeder <b>23</b> passing through the ideal pickup points of the leading components of the two tape feeders <b>23</b>, and feeding position correction operation performed such that the leading components of the two component feeders <b>23</b> are fed to component pickup positions C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b> that are the pickup points of the suction nozzles <b>26</b> on the two straight lines A<b>1</b> and A<b>2</b>, even if the positions of the leading components of the component supply tape set in the two tape feeders <b>23</b> is deviated, or if the positions of the two suction nozzles <b>26</b> to be used to pick up those components is deviated, after the position correction operation, the two suction nozzles <b>26</b> can be lowered simultaneously to pick up two components at the component pickup positions C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b>, thereby improving productivity.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0041">By performing the above position correction operation, even if the two tape feeders <b>23</b> have different tape feeding pitches (component sizes), it is possible to pick up the two components simultaneously using the two suction nozzles <b>26</b>, and, even if the position of each suction nozzle <b>26</b> is irregular, it is possible to pick up the two components simultaneously using the two suction nozzles <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0042">Note that, the present disclosure is not limited to the configuration of the above embodiments, and various changes may be made without departing from the scope, such as, the quantity of suction nozzles <b>26</b> may be changed, or the configuration of component mounter <b>10</b> may be changed.</p>

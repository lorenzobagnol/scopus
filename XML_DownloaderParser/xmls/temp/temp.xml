<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Note that, a mounting device that is provided with a mounting head that collects components, and that mounts the components on a board using a mounting head is given as an example of a device that adopts such an imaging processing method. In such a mounting device, there is a case where an image that includes a collected component is captured while moving the mounting head having collected the component. In addition, at this time, generating a composite image of a component using multiple images in the mounting device is considered. However, further widening an imaging range in the imaging processing method described above is not considered. Therefore, in the imaging processing method described above, productivity is lowered, for example, in a case where an imaging target is large, the composite image is generated by repeating the process of imaging by temporarily stopping the mounting head and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The disclosure is made in consideration of such problems, and the main object is to provide a mounting device, an imaging processing method, and an imaging unit that are able to obtain a higher quality image while further suppressing lowering of productivity.</p>

For example, the mounting system <b>10</b> is a system that performs a mounting process which relates to a process for mounting components <b>60</b> on a board S. The mounting system <b>10</b> is provided with the mounting device <b>11</b> and a management computer <b>50</b>. In the mounting system <b>10</b>, multiple mounting devices <b>11</b> that carry out the mounting process for mounting the components on the board S are arranged from the upstream to the downstream. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> indicates only one mounting device <b>11</b> for convenience of description. Note that, the mounting process includes processes for arrangement, mounting, inserting, joining, adhering, and the like of the components on the board. In addition, in the present embodiment, a left-right direction (X-axis), a front-rear direction (Y-axis), and an up-down direction (Z-axis) are as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>, the mounting device <b>11</b> is provided with a board conveyance unit <b>12</b>, a mounting unit <b>13</b>, a component supply unit <b>14</b>, an imaging unit <b>30</b>, and a control device <b>40</b>. The board conveyance unit <b>12</b> is a unit that carries out taking in and conveyance of the board S and fixing and taking out at the mounting position. The board conveyance unit <b>12</b> has a pair of conveyor belts that are provided with a clearance to the front-rear in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and bridge in the left-right direction. The board S is conveyed by the conveyor belts.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The mounting unit <b>13</b> collects the components <b>60</b> from the component supply unit <b>14</b>, and arranges the components <b>60</b> on the board S that is fixed to the board conveyance unit <b>12</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, for example, the components <b>60</b> are BGA components provided with multiple bumps <b>61</b> arranged in a lower portion of a main body with a relatively large plate shape. The mounting unit <b>13</b> is provided with a head moving section <b>20</b>, the mounting head <b>22</b>, and a suction nozzle <b>24</b>. The head moving section <b>20</b> is provided with a slider that is guided on a guide rail and moves in the XY-directions and a motor that drives the slider. The mounting head <b>22</b> is mounted to be removable on the slider, and moves in the XY-directions by the head moving section <b>20</b>. One or more suction nozzles <b>24</b> are mounted to be removable on a lower face of the mounting head <b>22</b>. In this arrangement, a case is mainly described in which four nozzles of suction nozzles <b>24</b><i>a</i>-<b>24</b><i>d </i>are mounted by the mounting head <b>22</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). In addition, in this arrangement, the suction nozzles <b>24</b><i>a</i>-<b>24</b><i>d </i>are collectively referred to as suction nozzles <b>24</b>. The suction nozzles <b>24</b> collect the components <b>60</b> utilizing negative pressure, and are mounted on the mounting head <b>22</b> to be removable. The mounting head <b>22</b> has a built-in Z-axis motor <b>23</b>, and adjusts the height of the suction nozzles <b>24</b> along the Z-axis using the Z-axis motor. In addition, the mounting head <b>22</b> is provided with a rotation device that rotates (spins) the suction nozzles <b>24</b> using a driving motor which is not shown in the drawings, and is able to adjust the angle of the components that are collected (sucked) to the suction nozzles <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, first fiducial marks <b>25</b><i>a </i>and <b>25</b><i>b </i>and second fiducial marks <b>26</b><i>a </i>and <b>26</b><i>b </i>that are reference positions of the collected components are arranged on the lower face side of the mounting head <b>22</b> to be removable and replaceable. Note that, in this arrangement, the first fiducial marks <b>25</b><i>a </i>and <b>25</b><i>b </i>are collectively referred to as first fiducial marks <b>25</b>, and the second fiducial marks <b>26</b><i>a </i>and <b>26</b><i>b </i>are collectively referred to as second fiducial marks <b>26</b>. In the mounting head <b>22</b>, the first fiducial marks <b>25</b> and the second fiducial marks <b>26</b> are arranged on the outer peripheral side of the suction nozzles <b>24</b>. The first fiducial marks <b>25</b> and the second fiducial marks <b>26</b> are arranged in a corner portion of the mounting head <b>22</b>, that is, on a corner side of an imaging range of the imaging unit <b>30</b>. In the mounting head <b>22</b>, the first fiducial marks <b>25</b> are arranged on a front side in the main movement direction (device rear side) of the mounting head <b>22</b> and the second fiducial marks <b>26</b> are arranged on a rear side in the main movement direction (device front side) of the mounting head <b>22</b>. The first fiducial marks <b>25</b> and the second fiducial marks <b>26</b> are provided with a support column and a disc shape mark member that is arranged on the distal end of the support column. For example, the first fiducial marks <b>25</b> are arranged at predetermined distances L<b>1</b> with a predetermined positional relationship with the second fiducial marks <b>26</b>. In addition, the first fiducial mark <b>25</b><i>a </i>is arranged with a predetermined positional relationship with the first fiducial mark <b>25</b><i>b </i>(at predetermined distance L<b>2</b>). In the same manner, the second fiducial mark <b>26</b><i>a </i>is arranged with a predetermined positional relationship with the second fiducial mark <b>26</b><i>b </i>(at the predetermined distance L<b>2</b>). The suction nozzles <b>24</b><i>a</i>-<b>24</b><i>d </i>have a predetermined positional relationship (distance or arrangement position) with the first fiducial marks <b>25</b> and the second fiducial marks <b>26</b>, therefore it is possible to recognize respective positions if it is possible to recognize the positions of either the first fiducial marks <b>25</b> or the second fiducial marks <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The component supply unit <b>14</b> is provided with multiple reels and is attached to be attachable to and detachable from a front side of the mounting device <b>11</b>. A tape is wound on each reel, and multiple components are held on a surface of the tape along a longitudinal direction of the tape. In a state in which the tape is unwound from the reel toward the rear, and the component are exposed, the tape is fed out by a feeder section to a collection position at which the components are sucked by the suction nozzles <b>24</b>. The component supply unit <b>14</b> is provided with a tray unit that has a tray in which multiple components are arranged and mounted. The tray unit is provided with a moving mechanism that moves the tray to the predetermined collection position, and in the tray unit, the tray is fixed to a pallet and is pulled out from a magazine cassette which is not shown in the drawings. Multiple rectangular pockets are formed in the tray, and the components are accommodated in the pockets. The components that are accommodated in the tray have a large height or size in comparison to a component that is accommodated on the reel. The components <b>60</b> are stored in the tray of the tray unit.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The imaging unit <b>30</b> is a unit that images the first fiducial marks <b>25</b> and the second fiducial marks <b>26</b> that have the mounting head <b>22</b> and the components that are sucked by the mounting head <b>22</b>. The imaging unit <b>30</b> is arranged between the component supply unit <b>14</b> and the board conveyance unit <b>12</b>. The imaging range of the imaging unit <b>30</b> is above the imaging unit <b>30</b>. The imaging unit <b>30</b> is provided with a lighting section <b>31</b>, an illumination control section <b>32</b>, an imaging device <b>33</b>, and an image processing section <b>34</b>. The lighting section <b>31</b> is configured to irradiate light upward and be able to irradiate light in multiple lighting states with respect to the components <b>60</b> that are held in the mounting head <b>22</b>. The illumination control section <b>32</b> controls the lighting section <b>31</b> based on a predetermined lighting state so as to be in a lighting state according to the components that are sucked by the suction nozzles <b>24</b>. The imaging device <b>33</b> is a device that outputs electric charge that is generated by receiving light. The imaging device <b>33</b> may be a CMOS image sensor that is able to carry out high-speed continuous acquisition processing by overlapping a transfer process of electric charge after exposure and an exposure process of a subsequent image. The image processing section <b>34</b> carries out a process in which image data is generated based on input electric charge. The imaging unit <b>30</b> images multiple images and outputs captured image data to the control device <b>40</b> after the suction nozzles <b>24</b> that suck the components <b>60</b> pass over the imaging unit <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the control device <b>40</b> is configured as a microprocessor with a CPU <b>41</b> as the center, is provided with a ROM <b>42</b> which stores a processing program, an HDD <b>43</b> which stores various data, a RAM <b>44</b> which is used as a work region, and an input and output interface <b>45</b> for performing exchange of an external device and an electrical signal, and the like, and these components are connected via a bus <b>46</b>. The control device <b>40</b> outputs a control signal to the board conveyance unit <b>12</b>, the mounting unit <b>13</b>, the component supply unit <b>14</b>, and the imaging unit <b>30</b>, and inputs a signal from the mounting unit <b>13</b>, the component supply unit <b>14</b>, and the imaging unit <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The management computer <b>50</b> is a computer that manages information on each device of the mounting system <b>10</b>. The management computer <b>50</b> is provided with an input device <b>52</b> such as a keyboard and a mouse for inputting various instructions by an operator, and a display <b>54</b> that displays various information.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Next, an operation of the mounting system <b>10</b> of the present embodiment that is configured in this manner, specifically, a mounting process of the mounting device <b>11</b> will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a flowchart illustrating an example of a mounting process routine which is performed by the CPU <b>41</b> of the control device <b>40</b>. The routine is stored in the HDD <b>43</b> of the control device <b>40</b>, and is performed according to a start instruction by the operator. In this arrangement, a case is mainly described in which the components <b>60</b> are mounted on the board S using the suction nozzles <b>24</b>. When the routine starts, first, the CPU <b>41</b> of the control device <b>40</b> acquires mounting job information from the management computer <b>50</b> (step S<b>100</b>). Information on mounting order of the components, the type and feature of the mounted components, the suction nozzles that suck the components, and the like are included in the mounting job information. Information on the size of the components, a reference image that is an image of a normal shape component, and the like are included in the feature of the components.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Next, the CPU <b>41</b> carries out a conveyance and fixing process of the board S (step S<b>110</b>), and sets the sucked components and acquires the information on the components from the mounting job information (step S<b>120</b>). Next, the CPU <b>41</b> mounts the suction nozzles <b>24</b> on the mounting head <b>22</b> according to need, and carries out an adsorption and movement process of the set component (step S<b>130</b>). In the suction process, the CPU <b>41</b> performs a process of moving the mounting head <b>22</b> to the collection position of the component supply unit <b>14</b> in which an equivalent component is stored and lowering the suction nozzles <b>24</b> and sucking the components <b>60</b> to the suction nozzles <b>24</b>. In the suction process, one or more components <b>60</b> may be sucked to the suction nozzles <b>24</b><i>a</i>-<b>24</b><i>d</i>. In addition, in the movement process, the CPU <b>41</b> carries out a process in which the mounting head <b>22</b> to which the components <b>60</b> are sucked passes above the imaging unit <b>30</b>, and moves to the mounting position of the board S. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is an explanatory diagram of the mounting head <b>22</b> that collects the components <b>60</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, when relatively large components <b>60</b> are sucked and held, a large area is occupied in a region of the mounting head <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Next, the CPU <b>41</b> performs imaging processing in which the mounting head <b>22</b> during movement (components <b>60</b>, and first fiducial marks <b>25</b> and second fiducial marks <b>26</b>) is imaged multiple times (step S<b>140</b>-<b>210</b>). In the imaging processing, a process is carried out in which multiple images are imaged and an image is obtained of high image quality components <b>60</b> by performing super-resolution processing. In the imaging processing, first, the CPU <b>41</b> determines whether or not an imaging timing of the first image is reached (step S<b>140</b>), and the CPU <b>41</b> waits without change when the imaging timing of the first image is not reached and carries out imaging processing on the first image when the imaging timing of the first image is reached (step S<b>150</b>). For example, in the imaging timing of the first image, all components <b>60</b> that are collected in the suction nozzles <b>24</b><i>a</i>-<b>24</b><i>d </i>may be in the same imaging range, and the imaging timing of the first image may be set to a timing at which at least the first fiducial marks <b>25</b> enter the imaging range of the imaging unit <b>30</b>. For example, the CPU <b>41</b> may cause the imaging unit <b>30</b> to capture the first image <b>71</b> after the components <b>60</b> and the first fiducial marks <b>25</b> enter the same imaging range prior to the second fiducial marks <b>26</b> entering the imaging range. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6(<i>a</i>) and 6(<i>b</i>)</figref> are explanatory diagrams of imaging processing for imaging multiple times, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(<i>a</i>)</figref> is the first image <b>71</b> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(<i>b</i>)</figref> is the second image <b>72</b>. When imaging at the imaging timing, during movement of the mounting head <b>22</b>, it is possible to cause the imaging unit <b>30</b> to capture the first image <b>71</b> that includes the first fiducial marks <b>25</b> and the components <b>60</b> that are collected on the mounting head <b>22</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(<i>a</i>)</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Next, the CPU <b>41</b> determines whether or not an imaging timing of the second image is reached (step S<b>160</b>), and the CPU <b>41</b> waits without change when the imaging timing of the second image is not reached and carries out imaging processing on the second image when the imaging timing of the second image is reached (step S<b>170</b>). For example, the imaging timing of the second image may be set to be a timing deviated by a &#xbd; pixel with respect to the first image such that it is possible to perform multi-frame super-resolution processing. In addition, in the imaging device <b>33</b>, the imaging timing of the second image may be a timing after an exposure process on the first image and transfer of electric charge after exposure are carried out and exposure of the second image is complete. Alternatively, for example, in the imaging timing of the second image, all components <b>60</b> that are collected in the suction nozzles <b>24</b><i>a</i>-<b>24</b><i>d </i>may be in the same imaging range, and the imaging timing of the second image may be set to a timing at which at least the second fiducial marks <b>26</b> enter the imaging range of the imaging unit <b>30</b>. For example, the CPU <b>41</b> may cause the imaging unit <b>30</b> to capture the second image <b>72</b> after the first fiducial marks <b>25</b> come out from the imaging range and the collected components <b>60</b> and the second fiducial marks <b>26</b> enter the same imaging range. When imaging at the imaging timing, during movement of the mounting head <b>22</b>, it is possible to cause the imaging unit <b>30</b> to capture the second image <b>72</b> that includes that components <b>60</b> that are collected on the mounting head <b>22</b> and the second fiducial marks <b>26</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(<i>b</i>)</figref>). Note that, each imaging timing does not exclude a case where the first fiducial marks <b>25</b> and the second fiducial marks <b>26</b> are included in the first image <b>71</b> and does not exclude a case where the first fiducial marks <b>25</b> and the second fiducial marks <b>26</b> are included in the second image <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Next, the CPU <b>41</b> carries out super-resolution processing for producing an image of the components <b>60</b> that are collected on the mounting head <b>22</b> using the first image <b>71</b> and the second image <b>72</b> based on the positional relationship of the first fiducial marks <b>25</b> and the second fiducial marks <b>26</b> (step S<b>180</b>). For example, super-resolution processing determines the position of the imaging targets (components <b>60</b>) that accurately overlap using multiple images, carries out a motion estimation process, a blur estimation process, and a reconstruction process, and produces a high resolution image in comparison to the imaged image. The super-resolution processing may be carried out by the image processing section <b>34</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7(<i>a</i>) and 7(<i>b</i>)</figref> are explanatory diagrams in which super resolution images <b>73</b> are generated from the first image <b>71</b> and the second image <b>72</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(<i>a</i>)</figref> is an image diagram of the bumps <b>61</b> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(<i>b</i>)</figref> is an image diagram of a chip component. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7(<i>a</i>) and 7(<i>b</i>)</figref>, in the mounting device <b>11</b>, it is possible to produce the high resolution image using an image with a relatively low resolution. In the mounting device <b>11</b>, it is required to image from the relatively small chip components up to a relatively large BGA components. Typically, the imaging unit <b>30</b> is not able to image a large component that has a narrow imaging range (visual field) when attempting to image a high resolution image, and the resolution is lowered when attempting to image a large-sized component. In the mounting device <b>11</b>, it is possible to sufficiently secure image resolution when imaging a small-sized component or a small part by carrying out super-resolution processing while sufficiently securing the imaging range when imaging the large-sized component.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In this arrangement, an image processing of the components <b>60</b> will be described. In the mounting device <b>11</b>, the mounting process may be carried out on the components <b>60</b> in which the external form is relatively large and a relatively small construction (bumps <b>61</b>) is arranged on the components. In this case, absence, the external form, or the like of the bumps <b>61</b> may be detected since it is determined whether the components <b>60</b> are normal. It is possible to detect with high precision absence, the external form, or the like of the bumps <b>61</b> by, for example, producing a high quality image by carrying out composition processing on multiple images, and carrying out multi-frame super-resolution processing. When multi-frame super-resolution processing is carried out, preferably the fiducial marks are imaged along with the components <b>60</b>, and images are superimposed by aligning the positions of the fiducial marks. In addition, in the mounting head <b>22</b>, the fiducial marks tend not to be arranged on the center side of the mounting head <b>22</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) when considering adsorption deviation, rotation, and the like in a case where multiple components with a relatively large external form such as the components <b>60</b> are sucked. For example, in a case where the fiducial marks are arranged on the outer peripheral side of the suction nozzles, the fiducial marks tend to come out from the imaging range when the components <b>60</b> that are collected on the mounting head <b>22</b> are included in the imaging range of the imaging unit <b>30</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). In the mounting device <b>11</b>, a problem is solved of using any fiducial marks (first fiducial marks <b>25</b> or second fiducial marks <b>26</b>) with clearly different positional relationships using an imaging frame and the fiducial marks tending to be out of the imaging range. For example, it is possible to specify the positions of the components <b>60</b> in the first image <b>71</b> using the coordinates from the first fiducial marks <b>25</b> and further it is possible to specify the distances between the first fiducial marks <b>25</b> and the second fiducial marks <b>26</b> in the second image <b>72</b> using the coordinates from the second fiducial marks <b>26</b>. Then, the CPU <b>41</b> produces high quality images by overlapping the images that are specified by the positions.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">After step S<b>180</b>, the CPU <b>41</b> calculates suction positional deviation amounts of the components <b>60</b> that are collected on the mounting head <b>22</b> using the produced super resolution images (step S<b>190</b>). For example, it is possible to obtain the suction positional deviation amounts as a difference between coordinate values of the X-axis and the Y-axis of the center positions of the components <b>60</b> and the center positions of the suction nozzles <b>24</b> based on the positional relationship of the center coordinates of the first fiducial marks <b>25</b>, the second fiducial marks <b>26</b>, and the suction nozzles <b>24</b>. Next, the CPU <b>41</b> determines whether or not the calculated suction positional deviation amounts are within the permissible range (step S<b>200</b>). For example, the permissible range is set in a range empirically determined to be a range of the positional deviation amounts at which it is possible to appropriately arrange the components <b>60</b> on the board S. When the suction positional deviation amounts are in the permissible range, the CPU <b>41</b> determines whether or not the shape of the component is within the permissible range (step S<b>210</b>). For example, in the determination, it is possible to carry out matching of a reference image and an image of the components <b>60</b> that are produced with super resolution images, and for example, carry out matching based on the matching degree based on the absence or the external form of the bumps <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The CPU <b>41</b> carries out a discarding process in which the components <b>60</b> are components in which a defect is generated when it is determined that a positional deviation amount or a shape difference is not within the permissible range in step S<b>200</b> or step S<b>210</b> (step S<b>220</b>). Meanwhile, when the shape of the component is within the permissible range in step S<b>210</b>, the CPU <b>41</b> performs a process in which the components P are mounted (arranged) at a position at which the calculated suction positional deviation amounts are corrected (step S<b>230</b>). Next, the CPU <b>41</b> determines whether or not the mounting process is completed by the mounting device <b>11</b> of the current board S (step S<b>240</b>), and the processes of step S<b>120</b> and thereafter are performed when the mounting process of the current board S is not complete. That is, the CPU <b>41</b> sets the components <b>60</b> that are subsequently sucked, the first image and the second image are imaged by the imaging unit <b>30</b> out of the collected components <b>60</b>, and the suction positional deviation amounts or shapes of the components <b>60</b> are determined by carrying out super-resolution processing. Meanwhile, when the mounting process of the current board S is completed in step S<b>240</b>, the CPU <b>41</b> discharges the board S on which mounting is completed (step S<b>250</b>), and determines whether or not production is completed (step S<b>260</b>). When the production is not completed, the CPU <b>41</b> performs the processes of step S<b>110</b> and thereafter. That is, the CPU <b>41</b> conveys and fixes a new board S and performs the processes of step S<b>120</b> and thereafter. Meanwhile, when production is completed in step S<b>260</b>, the CPU <b>41</b> ends the routine without any changes.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In this arrangement, the correspondence relationship between constituent elements of the present embodiment and constituent elements of the disclosure is clarified.

<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The mounting device <b>11</b> of the embodiment described above, during movement of a mounting head <b>22</b>, images the first image <b>71</b> that includes the components <b>60</b> that are collected in the mounting head <b>22</b> and first fiducial marks <b>25</b>, images the second image <b>72</b> that includes the components <b>60</b> that are collected in the mounting head <b>22</b> and the second fiducial marks <b>26</b>, and generates an image of the components <b>60</b> that are collected in the mounting head <b>22</b> using the first image <b>71</b> and the second image <b>72</b> based on the positional relationship of the first fiducial marks <b>25</b> and the second fiducial marks <b>26</b>. The mounting device <b>11</b> is able to carry out positioning of the first image <b>71</b> and the second image <b>72</b> utilizing the positional relationship of the first fiducial marks <b>25</b> and the second fiducial marks <b>26</b>, and obtain a high quality image that includes the components <b>60</b>. In addition, in the mounting device <b>11</b>, it is possible to further widen an imaging range up to a range that includes any fiducial mark and it is possible to suppress stopping of movement of the mounting head <b>22</b> while imaging the mounting head <b>22</b>. Accordingly, the mounting device <b>11</b> is able to obtain a higher quality image while further suppressing lowering of productivity.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In addition, in the mounting head <b>22</b>, it is possible to set the position of the first fiducial marks <b>25</b> and the second fiducial marks <b>26</b> further separated from each other and it is possible to further widen the imaging range since the first fiducial marks <b>25</b> and the second fiducial marks <b>26</b> are arranged on the outer peripheral side of the suction nozzles <b>24</b>. Furthermore, in this mounting device <b>11</b>, the mounting head <b>22</b> tends to obtain a higher quality image while further suppressing lowering of productivity since either of the first fiducial marks <b>25</b> and the second fiducial marks <b>26</b> tend to enter the imaging range even if the mounting head <b>22</b> moves since the first fiducial marks <b>25</b> and the second fiducial marks <b>26</b> are arranged on the front side and the rear side in the movement direction of the mounting head <b>22</b>. Still further, in the mounting device <b>11</b>, is obtained to use a higher quality image to carry out determination of whether the shapes and positions of the components <b>60</b> are appropriate since the control device <b>40</b> determines the shapes of the components <b>60</b> and the suction positions of the components <b>60</b> based on the image of the produced components <b>60</b>. Then, in the mounting device <b>11</b>, imaging efficiency is good since multiple components are imaged in the same image.</p>
